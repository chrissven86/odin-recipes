        <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
        <li>1 onion, diced</li>
        <li>1 pound ground beef</li>
        <li>1 pound ground pork</li>
        <li>2 large eggs</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons grated Parmesan cheese</li>
        <li>1/4 bunch fresh parsley, chopped</li>
        <li>3 cloves garlic, crushed</li>

    <p><h3>Steps</h3></p>
    <ol>
        <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
        <li>Cover a baking sheet with foil and spray lightly with cooking spray. Soak bread crumbs in milk in a
            <br>small bowl for 20 minutes.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, heat olive oil in a skillet over medium heat. Add onion; cook and stir until onion has 
            <br>softened and turned translucent, about 5 minutes. Reduce heat to low and continue cooking and 
            <br>stirring until onion is very tender, about 15 minutes more.</li>
            <li>Gently stir beef and pork together in a large bowl. Add onions, bread crumb mixture, eggs, 
                <br>Parmesan cheese, parsley, garlic, salt, black pepper, Italian herb seasoning, and red pepper 
                <br>flakes; mix together using a rubber spatula until combined. Cover and refrigerate for about 
                <br>one hour.</li>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).</li>
            <li>Form mixture into balls about 1 Â½ inches in diameter; arrange in a single layer on the prepared 
                <br>baking sheet.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until browned and cooked through, 15 to 20 minutes.</li>
            <li>Serve with your favorite tomato sauce and spaghetti. Enjoy!</li>
